                <p>Hey there! I'm Anne-Cathrine Hauge, a 35-year-old frontend 
                    developer in the making from the beautiful place of Naustdal 
                    on Norway's west coast. With beautiful mountains and fjords 
                    all around, I really enjoy living here!</p>
                <p>I'm currently diving deep into frontend development at 
                    Noroff University, with a solid year of experience under 
                    my belt. My toolkit includes Figma, HTML, CSS, and 
                    JavaScript. I absolutely love turning designs into 
                    interactive, user-friendly websites.</p>
                <p>When it comes to career goals, I'm all about working 
                    on projects that push my boundaries and help me grow. 
                    Right now, my focus is on completing  my studies and 
                    taking on small side projects to keep things exciting. 
                    Down the road, I dream of landing a full-time developer 
                    gig. I'm also thinking about learning backend development 
                    to eventually become a full-stack developer.</p>
                <p>When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me out in nature. 
                    Hiking up mountains, paddling on calm waters, or shredding 
                    snowy slopes on my snowboard—I'm always up for an adventure!</p>
                <p>Feel free to reach out if you're up for a collaboration 
                    or just want to say hi!</p>
